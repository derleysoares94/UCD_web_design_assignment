                <h1>How I Started Sleeping Better After Starting to Work Out</h1>
                <p>
                    Like many people, I used to struggle with getting a good night's sleep. I would toss and turn for hours, wake up feeling groggy, and go through the day feeling exhausted and irritable. No matter what I tried—sleeping pills, relaxation techniques, or even expensive mattresses—nothing seemed to work. That all changed when I made a simple but powerful change in my life: I started working out regularly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My journey began when I decided to join a local gym to improve my overall health. I started with light cardio exercises like walking on the treadmill and gradually incorporated strength training and group fitness classes. As I committed to a consistent workout routine, I noticed something incredible: my sleep began to improve dramatically.

                    Exercise has a profound impact on sleep quality.
                    The Science Behind It:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reduced Stress and Anxiety: Physical activity is a natural stress reliever. It helped me release built-up tension and anxiety, which often kept me awake at night. As my stress levels decreased, I found it easier to relax and fall asleep.
                    Increased Sleep Drive: Regular exercise helped regulate my body's internal clock, also known as the circadian rhythm. This made me feel more awake during the day and more tired at night, leading to a more natural sleep cycle.
                    Deeper Sleep: Engaging in physical activities, especially those that elevate the heart rate, improved the quality of my sleep. I started experiencing deeper, more restorative sleep, allowing me to wake up feeling refreshed and energized.
                    Better Mood: Exercise boosts the production of endorphins, the body's natural mood elevators. As my mood improved, so did my ability to unwind and enjoy a peaceful night's sleep.
