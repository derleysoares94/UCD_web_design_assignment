                <h2>Some Tips</h2>

                <p>
                    Feeling worn down by a high-pressure job? A morning workout may be best, according to Adrian:"Timing and the type of exercise you do are important, as exercise is a stress on the body and can release cortisol which is a stress hormone. However, our natural levels of cortisol are higher in the morning, so harder workouts are better done earlier in the day to fit with our body's natural cycle. In the evening, sticking to a gentler exercise such as yin or flow yoga will help calm your body and help you sleep."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Exercise tires our bodies and eases our minds, helping us sleep more soundly. But Adrian warns that working out too hard may have the opposite effect: "Completing a tough weight training session or an intense cardio session may disrupt our natural cortisol patterns, making us too alert to sleep well. Choosing a calmer workout will still work our bodies, improving strength and mobility, whilst also helping prepare us for sleep."
                </p>

                <p>To improve even more, we cab combine exercises with a balanced meal, eating health can also help improves our daily routine.</p>

                <p>I Started Sleeping Better After Starting to Work Out. Like many people, I used to struggle with getting a good night's sleep. I would toss and turn for hours, wake up feeling groggy, and go through the day feeling exhausted and irritable. No matter what I tried—sleeping pills, relaxation techniques, or even expensive mattresses—nothing seemed to work. That all changed when I made a simple but powerful change in my life: I started working out regularly.
