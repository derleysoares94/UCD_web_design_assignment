                <h1>Welcome to the Fitness Page</h1>
                <p>Here you will find information on the benefits of working out and basic exercises to get you started.</p>
                <p>Some benefits of physical activity for brain health happen right after a session of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity.
                    Benefits include improved thinking or cognition for children 6 to 13 and reduced short-term feelings of anxiety for adults.
                    Regular physical activity can help keep your thinking, learning, and judgment skills sharp as you age. It can also reduce your risk of depression and anxiety and help you sleep better.
                </p>
                <h2>Reduce your health risks</h2>
                <p>
                    Heart disease and stroke are two leading causes of death in the United States.
                    Getting at least 150 minutes a week of moderate physical activity can put you at a lower risk for these diseases.
                    You can reduce your risk even further with more physical activity. Regular physical activity can also lower blood pressure and improve your cholesterol levels.
                </p>
                <h2>Type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome</h2>
                <p>
                    Regular physical activity can reduce your risk of developing type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.
                    Metabolic syndrome is some combination of too much fat around the waist, high blood pressure, low high-density lipoproteins (HDL) cholesterol, high triglycerides, or high blood sugar.
                    With a regular schedule of moderate-intensity physical activity, people start to benefit from even less than 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity physical activity.
                    Additional amounts of physical activity could lower risk even more.
